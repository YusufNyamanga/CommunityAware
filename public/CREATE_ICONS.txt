# Simple PNG Icon Generator

Since creating actual PNG files programmatically is complex, here's a simple approach using online tools or the provided SVG files.

## Quick Solution:
1. Use the SVG files created in `public/logo192.svg` and `public/logo512.svg`
2. Convert them to PNG using any online converter
3. Save as `public/logo192.png` and `public/logo512.png`

## For now, the app will work without the PNG icons, but they are recommended for proper PWA functionality.

The service worker and manifest are properly configured. The app should be installable once the PNG icons are added.
